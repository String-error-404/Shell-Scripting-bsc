-----ARITHMETIC OPERATORS-----

* ALL THESE CONDITIONAL ARE MUST BE INSIDE THE SQUARE BRACES WITH SQUARE AROUND THEM...
	
* ALL ARITHMETIC CALCULATION ARE DONE WITH LONG INTEGERS...


-----RELATIONAL OPERATORS------

* THE RELATIONAL OPERATORS ARE THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO THE NUMERIC VALUES 

* THESE OPERATOR DO NOT WORK FOR STRING VALUES UNLESS  THERE VALUE IS NUMERIC


-----BOOLEAN OPERATORS---------


* THERE ARE THREE OF THEM

	* THE LOGICAL NEGATION
	* THE LOGICAL OR
	* THE LOGIBAL AND

-----STRING OPERATORS----------

-----FILE TEST-------

 -b FILE = CHECKS IF THE FILE BLOCK SPEACIAL FILE

 -c FILE = CHECKS IF THE FILE IS A CAT SPECIAL FILE

 -d FILE = CHEKCS IF TEH FILE IS A DIRECTORY 
 
 -f FILE = CHECKS THE FILE IS NORMAL FILE

 -g FILE = CHECKS IF THE FILE HAS SET GROUP ID...

 -k FILE = CHEKCS IF THE FILE HAS IT STICKY BIT SET

 -p FILE = CHECKS IF THE FILE NAMED PIPE 

 -t FILE = CHECKS IF THE FILE IS ASSOCIATED TO THE TERMINAL

 -u FILE = CHECKS IF FILE DESCIPTOR IS OPEN AND ASSOCIATED WITH A TERMINAL.IF YES THEN THE CONDITION BECOMES TRUE

 -r FILE = CHECKS IF THE FILE IS READABLE IF YES RETURNS TRUE 

 -w FILE = CHECKS IF THE FILE IS WRITABLE

 -x FILE = CHECKS IF THE FILE IS EXECUTABLE 

 -s FILE = CHECKS IF THE FILE GREATER THAN 0

 -e FILE = CHECKS IF THE FILE EXISTS
